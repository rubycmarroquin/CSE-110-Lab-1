### **Who am I?**
Hi! My name's Ruby, some people call me RC (first letter of my first and middle name). You might recognize me in class as the girl with the crazy hair colors. Currently I am a *senior* (YAY) and am graduating in the Spring of 2022! Some of my favorite things include playing video games, binge watching Netflix and anime movies/series, going on food adventures (in Tijuana), and hanging out with friends. ![](images/Screen%20Shot%202021-09-27%20at%208.00.25%20PM.png) ![](images/Screen%20Shot%202021-09-27%20at%208.00.35%20PM.png)

### **Who am I as a Programmer and Computer Scientist?**
As a programmer, my favorite programming languages are Python and SQL. In the future, I hope to become a Data Analyst (I am really ~~interested in~~ attracted and intrigued by Data Science) or a Software Developer.

## **Expectations for CSE 110**
I'll update these as the quarter continues: 
- [ ] Have a good group 
- [ ] Have fun 
- [ ] Learn new things regarding software engineering/development
- [ ] Gain experience 
- [x] Have a cool professor

I'm hoping to do well in this class, gain experience and insights in the reality of Software Development and Engineering, and have a great time. I plan on putting forth a lot of work and effort in this class, especially considering that it is a group effort (which, in my opinion, ends up being more work than an individual task). So, in the words of Elle Woods: 
> I'll show you how valuable ~~Elle Woods~~ Ruby Marroquin can be!
